Handle changing sampling frequencies (original)

Description:
============

- When looking for the event to be detected, both the template waveform and the
  waveform to be matched are not modified with regards to the sampling
  frequency.

- The data is split into 3 chunks:
  + The original data used for template waveform generation (rate=100Hz).
  + A resampled second chunk (generated using a resample:// recordstream
  (rate=20Hz)); shifted by one hour in time.
  + A copy of the first chunk of data but shifted by one hour in time.

  The second chunk and the third chunk are *contiguous* and correspond to the
  waveform data to be matched.

>>> st = read('data.mseed')
