Detect and handle changing sampling frequencies (downsampled)

- Configuration:

  + Do not apply filters.
  + Match an downsampled version of the template waveform with an downsampled
  version of the original waveform.

- Data and streams:

```
CH.GRIMS..HHZ | 2020-10-25T19:29:59.338393Z - 2020-10-25T19:40:01.008393Z | 100.0 Hz, 60168 samples
CH.GRIMS..HHZ | 2020-10-25T20:19:59.918393Z - 2020-10-25T20:29:59.328393Z | 100.0 Hz, 59942 samples
CH.GRIMS..HHZ | 2020-10-25T20:29:59.848393Z - 2020-10-25T20:40:00.498393Z | 20.0 Hz, 12014 samples
```

  + The data is split into 3 chunks:
    - The original data used for template waveform generation (rate=100Hz).
    - A second chunk (rate=100Hz); shifted by one hour in time.
    - A resampled version of the first chunk of data (created by means of the
    resample:// recordstream (rate=20Hz)) but shifted by one hour in time.

  The second chunk and the third chunk are *contiguous* and correspond to the
  waveform data to be matched.
