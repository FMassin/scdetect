Detect multiple events with short interevent time

- Configuration:

  + Test detection to detect two events that occur within 5 seconds.
  + Trigger facilities enabled; though the configured `"triggerDuration"` is
  greater than the interevent time, i.e. one detection candidate should be
  dropped due to an update of the triggering detection candidate

- Data and streams:
