scdetect-cc for Dummies
=======================


This tutorial is intended to guide you, while getting started with ``scdetect-cc``
. The most common usage scenarios are described step-by-step, i.e.:


* :ref:`offline-playback-label` which allows you to process historical
  waveform data.
* :ref:`real-time-playback-label` which may be used to process
  historical data while *simulating* real-time processing. This approach is
  based on injecting historic data into the :external:ref:`seedlink`.
* :ref:`real-time-application-label` which allows processing data
  in real-time.
